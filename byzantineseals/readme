This folder contains the code as well as files for the cleaning and preperation of Dumbarton oaks seals data. 
The cleaning took place in two files, named sealscleaning01 and sealscleaning02 respectively, the first being an R file and the second being an .ipynb jupyter notebook. 
The numbered data files are all the data used in the data processing files. Sealsdata10 was the final file used for the nodegoat import. I have kept the names as they appear in the processing files. 
The files are documented but not to a very high level. Please reach out with any questions or concerns.
